# Design decisions

Points where the implementation departs from the original design notes, or where
the reasoning is not obvious from the code.

## Always-on VPN runs *without* lockdown

The design called for
`setAlwaysOnVpnPackage(admin, package, lockdownEnabled = true)`. That turns out
to be incompatible with a DNS-only filter, and the combination was verified to
break the device completely.

Lockdown means "drop any traffic that does not go through the VPN interface".
This filter deliberately routes only the resolver addresses into its tunnel, so
with lockdown enabled every non-DNS packet on the device is dropped: names
resolve, then every `connect()` fails with `EPERM`, for every app. The phone has
no working internet at all.

The two are only compatible if the VPN carries *all* traffic, which requires the
userspace TCP/IP stack that v1 explicitly set out to avoid.

**What holds the line instead:** always-on itself (the platform restarts the
service), `START_STICKY`, and `DISALLOW_CONFIG_VPN` so no other VPN can be
configured or the filter swapped out. **What is lost:** the window between the
network coming up at boot and the tunnel being established, during which DNS
falls back to the system resolvers unfiltered.

If that window ever matters, closing it means phase 2 — full packet capture,
built on NetGuard or RethinkDNS rather than from scratch.

## The encrypted upstream uses DoT, not DoH

The upstream resolver is reached over DNS-over-TLS (`tls://all.dns.mullvad.net`),
not DNS-over-HTTPS, despite DoH being the more obvious choice.

Mullvad's DoH endpoint **only accepts HTTP/2** — verified: an HTTP/1.1 request is
closed without a response, an HTTP/2 request returns 200. Android's built-in
`HttpURLConnection` speaks HTTP/1.1 only, so a first implementation on top of it
failed on roughly every query and silently fell back to plain DNS. Making DoH
work would mean bundling a full HTTP/2 client into a service that stays resident
on the device permanently.

DoT gives exactly the same property — the local network can neither read the
lookups nor forge answers — over a protocol that is a TLS socket plus a two-byte
length prefix, using nothing beyond `javax.net.ssl`. Measured on device: 20
consecutive lookups, zero fallbacks, zero errors.

Two details that are easy to get wrong and are load-bearing:

- **`endpointIdentificationAlgorithm = "HTTPS"`** must be set explicitly on the
  socket. Without it the certificate is validated as a chain but never checked
  against the hostname, which leaves the connection open to exactly the
  interception DoT exists to prevent.
- **The upstream's own hostname is carved out of the blocklist** in
  `DnsFilter.decide`, before the block check. Every encrypted-DNS blocklist
  contains the public resolvers — that is what those lists are for — so without
  the carve-out the filter blocks its own upstream. It is also resolved over
  plain DNS rather than over the encrypted channel, because resolving the
  endpoint through itself is a deadlock.

The plain `upstreams` are still required: they bootstrap that hostname and take
over if DoT is unreachable. They are set to a *filtering* resolver so that losing
the encrypted hop degrades to a narrower filter rather than an open one.

## Policy is signed with ECDSA P-256, not Ed25519

`Signature.getInstance("Ed25519")` only exists from API 33, and these apps target
API 28. P-256 with SHA-256 is available through the platform provider on every
supported release, so signature verification needs no third-party crypto library
inside an app that runs an always-on network service. The envelope format,
rollback protection and key rotation are unchanged.

## HTTPS/SVCB queries are answered empty, not stripped from responses

The design called for stripping HTTPS/SVCB records (which carry ECH keys) out of
forwarded DNS responses. Doing that means rewriting a message whose answer
section is full of compression pointers into earlier offsets — every removal
shifts those offsets, and getting it subtly wrong corrupts answers in ways that
are very hard to diagnose.

Refusing the query instead — NOERROR with no records — achieves the same result:
no ECH configuration is ever delivered, so ECH is not negotiated. Clients fall
back to A/AAAA, which costs nothing. The parser in this codebase therefore reads
questions and *builds* answers, but never rewrites one.

## Blocklists are stored as hashes, not strings

A merged adult + gambling + ad list is a few hundred thousand domains. As a
`HashSet<String>` that is tens of megabytes of heap in a process that has to stay
resident. Compiled to a sorted array of 64-bit FNV-1a hashes it is 8 bytes per
domain, memory-mapped rather than heap-resident, and lookups are a binary search.

The trade-off is that the set cannot be enumerated and collisions cause false
positives. At 10⁶ entries the chance a given lookup collides is about 10⁻¹³ —
orders of magnitude below the rate at which the upstream lists contain mistakes.

## Browsers are detected, not listed

A package-name list of browsers is out of date the moment someone publishes a new
one. drawbridge instead asks `PackageManager` which packages can handle
`ACTION_VIEW` + `https` + `CATEGORY_BROWSABLE`, and removes any that is not the
one allowed browser. Zero list maintenance, and it catches browsers nobody
thought of.

A hardcoded protected list (`AppBlocker.NEVER_TOUCH`) guards the packages that
must survive regardless — system UI, Settings, the package installer, launchers,
Play Services. Some of those *do* register `https` intent filters, and removing
one would leave an unusable phone with no way to fix it, since the removal UI
lives on that same device.

## Neither app uses an `applicationIdSuffix` in debug builds

Both package names are load-bearing. Device Owner is bound to the exact package
used at provisioning time, and it appears in the adb command and the QR payload.
herald's package is named by the policy as the one allowed browser.

This was found the hard way: a `.debug` herald was silently uninstalled by
drawbridge's app blocker seconds after the device was provisioned, because a
browser whose package name is not the allowed one is exactly what that code
exists to remove.

## Debug builds skip `DISALLOW_DEBUGGING_FEATURES`

Applying it switches off USB debugging immediately, dropping the adb connection
and leaving no way to reinstall or inspect the app. Every other restriction still
applies in debug builds, and release builds always enforce it —
`BuildConfig.RETAIN_ADB_ACCESS`.

## herald has no search-suggestion dropdown

`browser-awesomebar` no longer exists in Android Components 153; the awesomebar
is Compose-only now. Rather than pull Jetpack Compose into an otherwise
View-based app, herald uses inline autocomplete from local history and a shipped
list of popular domains.

It is also a better fit for the product: search suggestions stream unfiltered
text straight from the search provider, which is exactly the content this browser
exists to keep off the screen.

## Subresource filtering goes through a web extension

`RequestInterceptor` only sees document loads — top-level pages and iframes. It
never sees images, scripts, XHR or media. A bundled MV2 extension holds a
blocking `webRequest` listener and asks the app about each new hostname over
native messaging, caching the answer for the life of the extension process.

The blocklist itself never crosses into JavaScript: it is hundreds of thousands
of entries in a memory-mapped file, and copying it into the extension's heap on
every policy update would be slow and pointless. Firefox allows a blocking
listener to return a Promise, so one native round trip per hostname is enough.

## herald is ~218 MiB per ABI, and that cannot be reduced here

GeckoView is a whole browser engine: `libxul.so` alone is 145 MiB. Per-ABI splits
are already enabled, without which a universal APK would be the sum of all three.

An earlier version of these notes claimed the size was unstripped debug symbols
and that building with an NDK would cut it by more than half. That is wrong, and
was measured to be wrong: `libxul.so` contains no `.symtab` and no `.debug_*`
sections, and `llvm-strip --strip-all` leaves it byte-for-byte identical. Mozilla
already ships stripped release libraries. Installing an NDK changes nothing.

What is actually available, if the download size ever becomes a problem:

- Publish only the ABIs you deploy to. `x86_64` exists for emulators; dropping it
  from a release removes a third of the upload, though it does not change what
  any real device downloads.
- Android App Bundles would let the store slice further, but that means Play
  distribution, which this project deliberately avoids.

Each provisioned device downloads its own ABI once, at provisioning time, and
then only on updates.
